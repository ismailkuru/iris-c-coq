\section{Automation}
\label{sec:auto}

We also developed some basic tactics for automatically solving the goals,
mostly related to our new language, some enhancing what Iris provides.

\subsection{Tactics for ``Symbolic Execution''}

Similar to what exists in Iris's heap-lang, we also provide convenient tactics
including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{wp\_bind <p>}: bind to a head term, or a term containing the head term, with pattern \texttt{p}
    \item \texttt{wp\_assign}: make a step by evaluating assignment's head term $l \la v$
        (it also shifts following statements by applying \texttt{wp\_seq} repetitively beforehand)
    \item \texttt{wp\_load}, \texttt{wp\_op}, \texttt{wp\_fst}, \texttt{wp\_snd} are similar to the one above
    \item \texttt{wp\_skip}: skip over any value before a sequencing operator
    \item \texttt{wp\_run}: keep executing as long as any of the above applies, which feels like doing
      symbolic execution automatically
    \item \texttt{wp\_ret}: return if the head expression is already value
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tactics for Algebraic Simplification}

\paragraph{\texttt{gmap} RA.}

\texttt{gmap\_simplify}: simplify expressions involving \texttt{gmap} based on some algebraic rules

\paragraph{$\refineM$ RA.}

\texttt{rewrite_op_cfgs}: Simplify product of the configuration list component.
