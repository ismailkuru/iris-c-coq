\section{Automation}
\label{sec:auto}

We also developed some basic tactics for automatically solving the goals,
mostly related to our new language, some enhancing what Iris provides.

\subsection{Tactics for ``Symbolic Execution''}

Similar to what exists in Iris's heap-lang, we also provide convenient tactics
including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{wp\_bind <p>}: bind to a head term, or a term containing the head term, with pattern \texttt{p}
    \item \texttt{wp\_assign}: make a step by evaluating assignment's head term $l \la v$
        (it also shifts following statements by applying \texttt{wp\_seq} repetitively beforehand)
    \item \texttt{wp\_load}, \texttt{wp\_op} are similar to the one above
    \item \texttt{wp\_skip}: skip over any value before a sequencing operator
    \item \texttt{wp\_run}: keep executing as long as any of the above applies, which feels like doing
        symbolic execution automatically
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other Tactics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{gmap\_rewrite}: simplify expressions involving \texttt{gmap} based on some algebraic rules
\end{itemize}
