This section contained some key formal developments claimed but not yet mechanized in Coq for reference.

\subsection{Properties of Evaluation Context}

Our expression $\Expr$ is a recursively defined algebraic data type, which can be generalized into the following form:

\[
e : \Expr \bnfdef{} \Expr_1(A_1, e^{r_1}) \mid ... \mid \Expr_n(A_n, e^{r_n}) \mid v
\]

Here, $\Expr_i$ is tag for $i$-th class of expression, $A_i$ is its arbitrary non-recursive payload, and $e^{r_i}$ means
it has $r_i \in \nat$ recursive occurences.

It is apparent that $\ectx$ is a direct translation of $\Expr$ plus some ordering considerations, though in actual Coq development we don't mechanize this fact.
But we will make it explicit here to support some stronger claims than what we can do in Coq.

For some abstract $\Expr$ like above, its $\ectx$ should be a sum of sub-$\ectx_i$ for each $\Expr_i$. When $r_i = 0$, $\ectx_i$ doesn't exist, now we consider
$r_i > 0$, define

\[
k_i: \ectx_i \bnfdef{} \ectx_{i1}(A_i, e^{r_i - 1}) \mid \ectx_{i2}(A_i, v^1, e^{r_i - 2}) \mid ... \mid \ectx_{ir_i}(A_i, v^{r_i - 1})
\]

\begin{theorem}
For any $e, e': \Expr$ and $k_{im}, k_{jn}: \ectx$,
\[k_{im}(e) = k_{jn}(e') \proves i = j \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} Trivial. \end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
For any $e, e': \Expr$ and $k_{im}, k_{in}: \ectx_i$,
\[k_{im}(e) = k_{in}(e') \proves
 (m = n \land e = e') \lor
 (m \neq n \land (\Exists v. \toval(e) = v \lor \Exists v. \toval(e) = v))\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} 

When $m = n$, by injectivity;
When $m \neq n$, we can expand the equation like below without loss of generality:
\begin{align*}
\Expr_i(A_i, v_1, ..., v_{m - 1}, &e, e_{m + 1}, ..., e_{r_i - 1}) = \\
\Expr_i(A_i', v_1', ..., v_{m - 1}', &v_m', ..., e', ...)
\end{align*}
So $e = v_m'$ by injectivity.
\end{proof}

Now, if we partition $\Expr$ into complete groups of disjoint classes, like $E_v, E_{red}, E_{jmp}$,
then we can trivially derive following lemma:

\begin{lemma}
For any $e, e': \Expr$ and $k, k': \ectx$,
\[
k(e) = k'(e') \proves (k = k' \land e = e') \lor (k \neq k' \land (e \in E_v \lor e' \in E_v))
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
For any $e \in E_{red}, e' \in E_{jmp}$ and $k, k': \ectx$,
\[
k(e) = k'(e') \proves \FALSE
\]
\end{lemma}
